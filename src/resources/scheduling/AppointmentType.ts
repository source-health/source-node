   * strategy is as follows:
   *
   * - care_team_required - Appointment slots will only be shown for Physicians who
   * are on the member's care team. If there are   no Physicians on the member's care
   * team, the request will fail.
   *
   * - care_team_preferred - Appointment slots will be shown for any Physicians on
   * the member's care team.   If the Physicians on the care team aren't available,
   * slots will not be returned.   If there are no Physicians on the member's care
   * team, then slots will be returned for any available Physician.
   *
   * - care_team_hybrid - Appointment slots will be shown for all users in the
   * Physicians group. For any given appointment slot,   if a Physician of the
   * member's care team is available, they will be preferred. However, slots for
   * other Physicians will   still be shown.
   *
   * - round_robin - Appointment slots will be shown for all users in the Physicians
   * group, and no preference will be given to   users who are also on the member's
   * care team.
   *
   * By default, Source uses the care_team_preferred strategy to provide continuity
   * of care and ensure patients have a consistent experience. However, this is not
   * always the right booking strategy for all practices. In fact, even for a single
   * practice, you may sometimes need to reach for another routing method.
